Fertilization begins when a sperm bumps into an egg and the sperm protein bindin attaches to the recognition sites on the egg surface. Gene sequences of bindin and egg-surface proteins vary greatly between closely related urchin species, thus reducing the chance of hybridization between species. In the burrowing sea urchin, Echinometra mathaei, the protein sequence for bindin varies even between populations within the same species. Do these differences affect fertilization? To test this, Palumbi (1999) carried out trials in which a mixture of sperm from AA and BB genotype males were added to dishes containing eggs of either the AA or the BB genotype. The results below indicate the proportion of successfully fertilized eggs (of both AA and BB genotypes) that were fertilized by AA genotype sperm. Note: we do not need to look at fertilization by BB sperm because by definition, the fraction will be 1 - fraction fertilized by AA sperm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the figure above to answer Questions 7–8.\n\n\n\n\nExamine the graph and visually determine the approximate value of the median for each egg genotype.

Mōlī remain at sea for a year or more after fledging and then return to their birthplace to breed on land.\nThe figure below shows the probability distribution for the age at first breeding in the Oʻahu population.

If it does hatch, the chick may not survive to fledge. Thus the total lifetime reproductive success (number of fledglings) per female is variable, depending on hatching and fledging success, and also the survival of the female and age of first reproduction (see Question 1.). The below figure shows a hypothetical distribution of total lifetime fledging success per female (i.e. total number of chicks fledged over a lifetime).

On each island, these spiders re-evolved distinctive color morphs that use different strategies to avoid depredation and catch prey. The “green” color morph is especially pretty. On Oʻahu there are two green morphs, one is T. tantalus shown above. On Hawaiʻi Island there is only one green morph–T. brevignatha. I used to spend a lot of time up in the ʻuka catching and identifying spiders, but being behind the computer all the time, I worry I lost those skills. A friend gave me a challenge: they showed me 10 pictures of Tetragnatha and told me 5 were T. tantalus, and 5 were T. brevignatha. My test was to correctly guess which was which. Don’t be fooled! Not all T. brevignatha have the red spot (some are all green), and some T. tantalus have a red spot of their own!\nOut of 10 trials, I got 7 right. My “scientific” hypothesis is that I still know how to ID spiders, but statistically, is that really supported by these data?"

(2007) who measured the diversity of plant, bird, and butterfly species in 15 urban green spaces of varying size. They also asked 312 green-space users about their emotional “attachment” to green spaces to see if more biodiverse green space lead to greater emotional attachment from users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachment\nArea (ha)\nNumber of butterfly species\nNumber of bird species\nln(Number of plant species)\n\n\n\n\n4.4\n23.8\n6\n12\n5.1\n\n\n4.5\n16.0\n14\n18\n5.5\n\n\n4.7\n6.9\n8\n8\n6.4\n\n\n4.5\n2.3\n10\n17\n4.7\n\n\n4.3\n5.7\n6\n7\n5.3\n\n\n3.8\n1.2\n5\n4\n4.6\n\n\n4.4\n1.4\n5\n8\n4.5\n\n\n4.6\n15.0\n7\n22\n5.5\n\n\n4.1\n3.1\n9\n7\n5.2\n\n\n4.2\n3.8\n5\n4\n4.6\n\n\n4.6\n7.6\n10\n11\n4.5\n\n\n4.2\n12.9\n9\n11\n5.0\n\n\n4.3\n4.0\n12\n13\n5.0\n\n\n4.4\n5.6\n11\n16\n5.6\n\n\n4.2\n4.9\n7\n7\n5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions 1–5 refer to the prompt and data above\n\n\n\nTo get these data into R you can copy-paste and run this code:\n\nfuller_etal_2017 &lt;- data.frame(\n    attachment = c(4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 3.8, 4.4, 4.6, 4.1,\n                   4.2, 4.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.2),\n    area_ha = c(23.8, 16.0, 6.9, 2.3, 5.7, 1.2, 1.4, 15.0, 3.1, \n                3.8, 7.6, 12.9, 4.0, 5.6, 4.9),\n    butterfly = c(6, 14, 8, 10, 6, 5, 5, 7, 9, 5, 10, 9, 12, 11, 7),\n    bird = c(12, 18, 8, 17, 7, 4, 8, 22, 7, 4, 11, 11, 13, 16, 7),\n    ln_plant = c(5.1, 5.5, 6.4, 4.7, 5.3, 4.6, 4.5, 5.5, 5.2, \n                 4.6, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.6, 5.4)\n)\n\n\nIf our question is “does greater bird diversity increase attachment?”, which graph below best visualizes the data in a way consistent with this question?
