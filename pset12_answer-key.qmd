## Benefits of biodiversity {.unnumbered}

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%", fig.cap="Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden, an urban green space on O'ahu. Photo credit: Daniel Ramirez / Flickr"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hoomaluhia.jpeg")
```

[Fuller *et al.* (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0149) measured the diversity of plant, bird, and butterfly species in 15 urban green spaces of varying size. They also asked 312 green-space users about their emotional "attachment" to green spaces to see if more biodiverse green space lead to greater emotional attachment from users.


```{r}

fuller_etal_2017 <- tibble(
    attachment = c(4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 3.8, 4.4, 4.6, 4.1,
                   4.2, 4.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.2),
    area_ha = c(23.8, 16.0, 6.9, 2.3, 5.7, 1.2, 1.4, 15.0, 3.1, 
                3.8, 7.6, 12.9, 4.0, 5.6, 4.9),

## Questions 1--5 refer to the prompt and data above

To get these data into *R* you can copy-paste and run this code:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fuller_etal_2017 <- data.frame(
    attachment = c(4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 3.8, 4.4, 4.6, 4.1,
                   4.2, 4.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.2),
    area_ha = c(23.8, 16.0, 6.9, 2.3, 5.7, 1.2, 1.4, 15.0, 3.1, 
                3.8, 7.6, 12.9, 4.0, 5.6, 4.9),
    butterfly = c(6, 14, 8, 10, 6, 5, 5, 7, 9, 5, 10, 9, 12, 11, 7),
    bird = c(12, 18, 8, 17, 7, 4, 8, 22, 7, 4, 11, 11, 13, 16, 7),
    ln_plant = c(5.1, 5.5, 6.4, 4.7, 5.3, 4.6, 4.5, 5.5, 5.2, 
                 4.6, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.6, 5.4)
)
```

1. Calculate the product-moment correlation coefficient for each of the following pairs of numerical variables:

    a. Attachment and Number of butterfly species [1 point]
    b. Attachment and Number of bird species [1 point]
    c. Attachment and ln(Number of plant species) [1 point]

## Answers

*a. Attachment and Number of butterfly species*

```{r echo = TRUE}
cor(fuller_etal_2017$butterfly, fuller_etal_2017$attachment)
```

*b. Attachment and Number of bird species*

```{r echo = TRUE}
cor(fuller_etal_2017$bird, fuller_etal_2017$attachment)
```

*c. Attachment and ln(Number of plant species)*

```{r echo = TRUE}
cor(fuller_etal_2017$ln_plant, fuller_etal_2017$attachment)
```

2. Which measure of biodiversity is most strongly correlated with attachment? [1 point]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

Number of bird species has the highest correlation with Attachment


:::

3. Larger green spaces (greater area) might have more species and cause greater emotional attachment. Calculate the correlation between Area (ha) and Attachment. Round your answer to the nearest 0.01. [1 point]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

```{r echo = TRUE}
cor(fuller_etal_2017$area_ha, fuller_etal_2017$attachment)
```

:::

4. This question refers to Question 3. Using `cor.test`, what is the $P$-value and 95% CI of the correlation between green space area and attachment? [1 point]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

```{r echo = TRUE}
cor.test(fuller_etal_2017$area_ha, fuller_etal_2017$attachment)
```

:::

5. This question refers to Questions 3 and 4. Calculate the $P$-value for the correlation test "by hand" using the *t* distribution.  To answer this question, paste your code into the google form. [2 point, partial credit will be given]

    Your code should show (at a minimum):
    
    - how you calculate the degrees of freedom
    - how you use one of the *t* distribution functions (either `dt`, `pt`, `qt`, or `rt`) to calculate the *P*-value

```{r echo = TRUE}
# calculate correlation coeff
cor_area_ha <- cor(fuller_etal_2017$attachment, 
                   fuller_etal_2017$area_ha)

# could have alternatively just copied the cor coef 
# from question 3, either approach is fine
cor_area_ha <- 0.3640941

# calculate df
df <- nrow(fuller_etal_2017) - 2

# calculate test stat from cor coeff and SE
SE_r <- sqrt((1 - cor_area_ha ^ 2) / df)
test_stat <- cor_area_ha / SE_r

# calculate P-val
P_value <- 2 * pt(test_stat, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)
P_value

## Visualizing correlation {.unnumbered}

Suppose that you measure two numerical variables $X$ and $Y$. The figure below depicts four possible outcomes.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}

set.seed(20210419)
df1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), 
                                                       ncol = 2)) %>%
    as_tibble(.name_repair = NULL) %>% 
    set_colnames(c("x", "y"))

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- sqrt(rlnorm(100, sqrt(exp(x - min(x))), 3))
y <- y / max(y) * 4 - 2
df2 <- tibble(x = x, y = y)


df3 <- MASS::mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.9, 0.9, 1), 
                                                       ncol = 2)) %>%
    as_tibble(.name_repair = NULL) %>% 
    set_colnames(c("x", "y"))

df4 <- MASS::mvrnorm(100, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, -0.9, -0.9, 1), 
                                                       ncol = 2)) %>%
    as_tibble(.name_repair = NULL) %>% 
    set_colnames(c("x", "y"))

gp1 <- ggplot(df1, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlim(-3.5, 3.5) +
    ylim(-3.5, 3.5) +
    xlab(expression(italic(X))) +
    ylab(expression(italic(Y))) +
    coord_equal() +
    theme_cowplot()

gp2 <- gp1 %+% df2
gp3 <- gp1 %+% df3
gp4 <- gp1 %+% df4

plot_grid(gp1, gp3, gp4, gp2, nrow = 2, labels = "AUTO")

```
