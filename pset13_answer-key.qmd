## Benefits of biodiversity {.unnumbered}

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%", fig.cap="Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden, an urban green space on O'ahu. Photo credit: Daniel Ramirez / Flickr"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hoomaluhia.jpeg")
```

Just like in the problem set on correlation, we will again look at the data from [Fuller *et al.* (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0149) who measured the diversity of plant, bird, and butterfly species in 15 urban green spaces of varying size. They also asked 312 green-space users about their emotional "attachment" to green spaces to see if more biodiverse green space lead to greater emotional attachment from users.


```{r}

fuller_etal_2017 <- tibble(
    attachment = c(4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 3.8, 4.4, 4.6, 4.1,
                   4.2, 4.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.2),
    area_ha = c(23.8, 16.0, 6.9, 2.3, 5.7, 1.2, 1.4, 15.0, 3.1, 
                3.8, 7.6, 12.9, 4.0, 5.6, 4.9),
    butterfly = c(6, 14, 8, 10, 6, 5, 5, 7, 9, 5, 10, 9, 12, 11, 7),
    bird = c(12, 18, 8, 17, 7, 4, 8, 22, 7, 4, 11, 11, 13, 16, 7),
    ln_plant = c(5.1, 5.5, 6.4, 4.7, 5.3, 4.6, 4.5, 5.5, 5.2, 
                 4.6, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.6, 5.4)
)

cor_area_ha <- cor(fuller_etal_2017$attachment, fuller_etal_2017$area_ha)
cor_butterfly <- cor(fuller_etal_2017$attachment, fuller_etal_2017$butterfly)

cor_ln_plant <- cor(fuller_etal_2017$attachment, fuller_etal_2017$ln_plant)

df <- nrow(fuller_etal_2017) - 2
SE_r <- sqrt((1 - cor_area_ha ^ 2) / df)
test_stat <- cor_area_ha / SE_r
P_value <- 2 * pt(test_stat, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)

fuller_etal_2017 %>%
    rename(
        Attachment = attachment,
        `Area (ha)` = area_ha,
        `Number of butterfly species` = butterfly,
        `Number of bird species` = bird,
        `ln(Number of plant species)` = ln_plant,
    ) %>%
    knitr::kable()

## Questions 1--5 refer to the prompt and data above

To get these data into *R* you can copy-paste and run this code:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
fuller_etal_2017 <- data.frame(
    attachment = c(4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 3.8, 4.4, 4.6, 4.1,
                   4.2, 4.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.2),
    area_ha = c(23.8, 16.0, 6.9, 2.3, 5.7, 1.2, 1.4, 15.0, 3.1, 
                3.8, 7.6, 12.9, 4.0, 5.6, 4.9),
    butterfly = c(6, 14, 8, 10, 6, 5, 5, 7, 9, 5, 10, 9, 12, 11, 7),
    bird = c(12, 18, 8, 17, 7, 4, 8, 22, 7, 4, 11, 11, 13, 16, 7),
    ln_plant = c(5.1, 5.5, 6.4, 4.7, 5.3, 4.6, 4.5, 5.5, 5.2, 
                 4.6, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.6, 5.4)
)
```

1. If our question is "does greater bird diversity increase attachment?", which graph below best visualizes the data in a way consistent with this question? [1 point]

```{r fig.align='center'}
gp1 <- ggplot(fuller_etal_2017, aes(attachment, bird)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Attachment") +
  ylab("Number of bird species") +
  theme_cowplot()

gp2 <- ggplot(fuller_etal_2017, aes(bird, attachment)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Attachment") +
  xlab("Number of bird species") +
  theme_cowplot()

plot_grid(gp1, gp2, nrow = 1, labels = "AUTO")
```

**B**

2. If our question is "does greater bird diversity increase attachment?" what is the best null hypothesis in a linear regression framework? [1 point]

    a. H_0: The slope of **(change in bird species richness)** versus **(change in attachment)** is 0
    b. H_0: The slope of **(change in attachment)** versus **(change in bird species richness)** is 0
    c. H_0: The slope of **(change in attachment)** versus **(change in bird species richness)** is not 0
    d. H_0: The slope of **(change in bird species richness)** versus **(change in attachment)** is less than 0

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

b. H_0: The slope of **(change in attachment)** versus **(change in bird species richness)** is 0

:::

3. Calculate the estimated slope for each of the following relationships:

    a. Attachment as predicted by Number of butterfly species [1 point]
    b. Attachment as predicted by Number of bird species [1 point]
    c. Attachment as predicted by Area [1 point]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answers

a. Attachment as predicted by Number of butterfly species

```{r echo = TRUE}
mod_bfly <- lm(attachment ~ butterfly, data = fuller_etal_2017)
summary(mod_bfly)
```

The slope is `r as.numeric(round(mod_bfly$coefficients[2], 3))`

b. Attachment as predicted by Number of bird species

```{r echo = TRUE}
mod_bird <- lm(attachment ~ bird, data = fuller_etal_2017)
summary(mod_bird)
```

The slope is `r as.numeric(round(mod_bird$coefficients[2], 3))`

c. Attachment as predicted by Area

```{r echo = TRUE}
mod_area <- lm(attachment ~ area_ha, data = fuller_etal_2017)
summary(mod_area)
```

The slope is `r as.numeric(round(mod_area$coefficients[2], 3))`

4. For the linear model predicting Attachment from Number of bird species, report the results for a $t$-test null hypothesis test. Specifically, report the $t$-statistic, degrees of freedom, and $P$-value. [1 point]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

```{r echo = FALSE}
foo <- summary(mod_bird)
out <- foo$coefficients[2, 3:4, drop = FALSE]
rownames(out) <- NULL
out <- cbind(out[, 1, drop = FALSE], 
             df = foo$df[2], 
             out[, 2, drop = FALSE])
knitr::kable(out)
```

5. Use the `confint` function to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the slope of Attachment as predicted by Number of bird species. [1 point]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

```{r echo = TRUE}
confint(mod_bird, "bird")
```

:::

6. Use `ggplot` code to show the data for Attachment as predicted by Number of bird species, the regression line for this relationship, and the 95% confidence band. Copy and paste your code into the google form to answer this question. [1 point]

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2) # not necessary for student to show library call

ggplot(fuller_etal_2017, aes(x = bird, y = attachment)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

7. Based on your findings from questions 2--6, do you reject the null hypothesis? What, if any, caveats should you state when interpreting the relationship between Attachment and Number of bird species? [2 points]

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Answer

We reject the null. We can interpret number of bird species as having a significant positive relationship with attachment. Some caveats we could consider include (students can report any **one** of these, or another if it seems valid):

- $n = 15$ is a pretty small sample size
- perhaps because of small sample size, our 95% CI is close to 0
- correlation is not causation
