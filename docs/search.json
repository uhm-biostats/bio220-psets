Assume no one is added or subtracted (dies) from the population during sampling. El Dorado is divided into 10 regions that vary widely in their population size. To randomly select participants, you are given a list of all living adults in El Dorado arranged by Region and alphabetically by surname (last name) within Region like this:\n\n\n\nRegion\nName\nID Number\n\n\n\n\nA\nAaronson, A\n1\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nA\nZykowski, Z\n65184\n\n\nB\nAaronson, A\n65185\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nB\nZykowski, Z\n187706\n\n\nC\nAaronson, A\n187707\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nC\nZykowski, Z\n245906\n\n\n\nEach adult also has unique ID Number determined by their Region and Name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following four sampling procedures to select participants, then answer questions 3 & 4.\n\n\n\n\nA.

[1 point]\nAfter starting the trial on participants, you learn that a technician accidentally used a nonrandom sampling procedure that is likely to bias your estimate. The technician suggests that you ask for more funding to increase the sample size to 200 while continuing to use the same biased sampling procedure. If you adopt their suggestion, what is most likely true about the resulting estimate from the sample of 200?

You can use any method you want to assign groups, as long as it is truly random. You need to upload your work to show how your randomization procedure works. This could be any of the following:\n\na scanned piece of paper showing randomization\na Google Sheet/Doc with randomization procedure\na short video describing and showing your randomization procedure\nan R script\nsomething else, as long as it’s clear what you did.\n\nYou cannot just send the name of students in each group; you must show your randomization procedure."
