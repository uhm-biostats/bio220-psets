Fertilization begins when a sperm bumps into an egg and the sperm protein bindin attaches to the recognition sites on the egg surface. Gene sequences of bindin and egg-surface proteins vary greatly between closely related urchin species, thus reducing the chance of hybridization between species. In the burrowing sea urchin, Echinometra mathaei, the protein sequence for bindin varies even between populations within the same species. Do these differences affect fertilization? To test this, Palumbi (1999) carried out trials in which a mixture of sperm from AA and BB genotype males were added to dishes containing eggs of either the AA or the BB genotype. The results below indicate the proportion of successfully fertilized eggs (of both AA and BB genotypes) that were fertilized by AA genotype sperm.

Mōlī remain at sea for a year or more after fledging and then return to their birthplace to breed on land.\nThe figure below shows the probability distribution for the age at first breeding in the Oʻahu population.

If it does hatch, the chick may not survive to fledge. Thus the total lifetime reproductive success (number of fledglings) per female is variable, depending on hatching and fledging success, and also the survival of the female and age of first reproduction (see Question 1.). The below figure shows a hypothetical distribution of total lifetime fledging success per female (i.e. total number of chicks fledged over a lifetime). Hypothetical, but again based on real published research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the above figure to answer question 2–3\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you find a female mōlī who has currently successfully fledged a chick.

Avian pox virus also influences whether fledglings will return to reproduce after their adolescent years at sea.\n\n\n\nA mōlī chick with avian pox virus\n\n\nVanderWerf and Young (2016) studied the effect of avian pox virus on chick survival and recruitment back into the breeding colony (i.e. returning to Oʻahu to breed). They found that chick survival probability was 0.79 when not infected with avian pox virus, versus 0.68 probability when severely infected. Recruitment probability was measured by estimating the proportion of fledged birds that returned to the breeding colony by age 9. The recruitment probability, thus defined, for birds not infected was 0.58, versus 0.39 when severely infected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the above information about survival and recruitment to answer questions 4–5.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the events of “survive” and “recruit”\n\nSelect one answer: are the events of “survive” and “recruit” mutually exclusive or not?
