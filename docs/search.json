    "text": "Random sampling for a clinical trial\nSuppose you are designing a clinical trial for a new drug and you have enough budget to afford a trial with 100 participants randomly selected from the total (finite) population of adults living in the fictional country of El Dorado. Assume no one is added or subtracted (dies) from the population during sampling. El Dorado is divided into 10 regions that vary widely in their population size. To randomly select participants, you are given a list of all living adults in El Dorado arranged by Region and alphabetically by surname (last name) within Region like this:\n\n\n\nRegion\nName\nID Number\n\n\n\n\nA\nAaronson, A\n1\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nA\nZykowski, Z\n65184\n\n\nB\nAaronson, A\n65185\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nB\nZykowski, Z\n187706\n\n\nC\nAaronson, A\n187707\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nC\nZykowski, Z\n245906\n\n\n\nEach adult also has unique ID Number determined by their Region and Name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following four sampling procedures to select participants, then answer questions 4 & 5.\n\n\n\n\nA. Choose the first 100 individuals in the list  B. Choose the first 10 individuals from each Region  C. Use a random number generator to select 10 ID Numbers from each region  D. Use a random number generator to select 100 ID Numbers from the country population\n\n\nWhich of the sampling procedures (A, B, C, or D) is most likely to produce a biased estimate of the true population response to the drug? [1 point]\nAfter starting the trial on participants, you learn that a technician accidentally used a nonrandom sampling procedure that is likely to bias your estimate. The technician suggests that you ask for more funding to increase the sample size to 200 while continuing to use the same biased sampling procedure. If you adopt their suggestion, what is most likely true about the resulting estimate from the sample of 200?

All students in your section will be divided into groups of 4 to 5 students each. For this activity, you will randomly assign students to groups. Each student must be assigned to one and only one group. Assume there are 23 students in your section, and you can simply “name” each student “Student 01”, “Student 02”, …, “Student 23”. You can use any method you want to assign groups, as long as it is truly random. You need to upload your work to show how your randomization procedure works. This could be any of the following:\n\na picture of a piece of paper showing randomization\na Google Sheet/Doc with randomization procedure\na short video describing and showing your randomization procedure\nan R script\nsomething else, as long as it’s clear what you did.\n\nYou cannot just send the “names” of students in each group; you must show your randomization procedure.",
